Outline of the Project:
Garrett and Indrani split the work evenly but also helped each other out on a couple parts where either of us were stuck or needed a second pair of eyes to see if we were making other errors. 
Indrani started the project off by creating the data frames in VS code and making sure we had the correct data to move forward with later in the project. After Indrani finished collecting all the data, we decided to choose option 1 for creating the contacts data frame. On this part we worked together to figure out the correct code for the solution. 
The second part is where Garrett would be working on the SQL and creating all the tables that would be needed and uploaded as well creating the ERD. When it came to creating the ERD, we wanted to make sure our data matched up with the data from the beginning of the project. So, Garrett and Indrani were able to figure out the final outcome for the ERD and all the Results matched up with the data we were provided.
